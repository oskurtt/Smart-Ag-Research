What Web Servers Do:
- listens
- on a port
- for a request
- transport protocol
- response
- resource

Web server sits idle until request is made

Web server is listening to a nework port provided by the OS that the web server
is running on.

Web server operates on one of many different ports
Default HTTP -> Port 80
Default HTTPS -> Port 443
Thus, you can run multiple web servers on one computer

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - one form in which webservers communicate
to each other in simply text

Example Request.txt file in HTTP:

GET /orders/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8000 
User-Agent: Manual-Http-Request
Content-Length: 12
Content-Type: text/html
order_id = 123

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - FTP servers are used to transfer files

After a request, a web server will send back resources based on what it was requested

Static Routing:
For example, if you request an image of a dog, the webserver needs to find the
which resource to return via a process called routing, connecting a request with
the requested resource. You can direct your webserver to a directory in your
computer which contains the requested resources.

Dynamic Routing:
Unlike static routing, dynamic routing will save the data into a database which
will be later served dynamically. This means you would have to configure your 
webserver to route all requests to a file or executable which serves an entry for
your web application.
