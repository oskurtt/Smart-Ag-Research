API stands for Application Programming Interface

API lets your service communicate wiht other services wihtout having to know how they're implemented.
This allows simplification of app development, saves time and money. 

Buisinesses often need to adapt quickly in response to the market where new compeitors are constantly creating
new services for the industry. Thus, it's important to use Cloud services to deploy innovative applications which 
relies on services provided by APIs.

For example:
Book store utilizes a cloud app to let customers check book avaiability. This app is expensive, time consuming, and
limited by platforms. Alternatively, you can use an API.
Benefits:
- letting customers access data via API helps collect information in a single place
- book store can make changes to its internal systems without impacting customers
- developers can work on more features/apps to offer more services for customers leading to higher sales

You can also offer your API services to other partners of your company or the public. 
Benefits:
- create new forms of revenue
- expand your brand
